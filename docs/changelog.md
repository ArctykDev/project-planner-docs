# Changelog

All notable changes to Obsidian Project Planner will be documented in this file.

## [0.6.2] - 2026-01-13

### Added

#### Bidirectional Markdown Sync

- **Full Bidirectional Sync**: Complete two-way synchronization between plugin JSON data and vault markdown notes
  - Tasks sync to individual markdown files in `{ProjectName}/Tasks/` folders
  - YAML frontmatter contains all task metadata (status, priority, dates, dependencies, etc.)
  - Markdown body includes description, subtasks (checkbox lists), and links
  - Real-time automatic sync using metadata cache and vault event watchers
- **Markdown Content Parsing**: Full parsing of markdown files including:
  - Description text (content before first heading)
  - Subtasks from checkbox lists (`- [ ] item` format)
  - Wiki links (`[[Page]]`) and external links (`[text](url)`)
- **Sync Settings**: Three configurable options in plugin settings:
  - `enableMarkdownSync`: Toggle sync feature on/off
  - `autoCreateTaskNotes`: Automatically create markdown files when tasks are created in UI
  - `syncOnStartup`: Perform initial sync of all tasks when plugin loads
- **Manual Sync Button**: "Sync All Tasks Now" button in settings for bulk synchronization
- **Console Debugging**: Extensive logging with `[TaskSync]` prefix for troubleshooting sync operations

#### Project Metadata Tracking

- **Created/Updated Timestamps**: Projects now track creation and last updated dates
- **Dashboard Project Display**: Dashboard shows project metadata with timestamps and task counts
- **Clickable Project Cards**: Dashboard project cards navigate to Grid view for that project

#### UI Improvements

- **Filter Label Visibility**: Active filters now show clear labels in Grid view header
- **Dashboard Enhancements**: Improved project card layout and metadata display

### Fixed

- **Symmetric Sync**: Markdown-to-plugin sync now captures all content (previously only YAML was synced back)
- **Live Sync**: Watchers trigger automatically without requiring manual sync button clicks
- **Sync Loop Prevention**: Set-based tracking prevents infinite sync loops between UI and markdown changes

### Technical

- **TaskSync Utility**: New `src/utils/TaskSync.ts` class managing all sync operations
- **Metadata Cache Events**: Primary event listener using `metadataCache.on('changed')` for reliable YAML detection
- **Vault Event Handlers**: Backup watchers for file create, modify, and delete operations
- **TaskStore Methods**: New `addTaskFromObject()` and helper methods (`getTaskById`, `getTasks`) for sync integration
- **Sync State Tracking**: `syncInProgress` Set with 200ms timeout to prevent circular updates

### Documentation

- **MARKDOWN_SYNC.md**: Complete guide to bidirectional sync feature, YAML format, and troubleshooting
- **View Descriptions**: Updated documentation with high-level descriptions of all six views
- **Plugin Introduction**: New comprehensive overview paragraph for documentation

## [0.6.1] - 2026-01-07

### Added

- **View Tab Opening Behavior**: New `openViewsInNewTab` setting to control whether views open in the same tab or create new tabs
  - When disabled (default): Clicking view buttons replaces content in the active tab
  - When enabled: Each view button creates a new tab
- **Bucket Selection in Task Details**: Added dropdown selector to assign tasks to buckets directly from the task details panel
- **Bucket Column in Grid View**: New hideable "Bucket" column in grid view for quick bucket assignment and visibility

### Fixed

- **Workspace Initialization**: Fixed plugin initialization error by waiting for workspace layout to be ready before opening default view
- **Tab Reuse Logic**: Corrected `openViewsInNewTab` setting behavior to properly reuse active leaf or create new tabs based on user preference

  - When disabled (default): Clicking view buttons replaces content in the active tab
  - When enabled: Each view button creates a new tab

#### Infrastructure

- **GitHub Actions Release Workflow**: Automated build and release process that:
  - Triggers on version tags (e.g., `v0.6.0`)
  - Builds the plugin automatically
  - Extracts version from manifest.json
  - Uploads `main.js`, `manifest.json`, and `styles.css` as release assets
  - Supports BRAT plugin installation

### Fixed

- **Workspace Initialization**: Fixed plugin initialization error by waiting for workspace layout to be ready before opening default view
- **Tab Reuse Logic**: Corrected `openViewsInNewTab` setting behavior to properly reuse active leaf or create new tabs based on user preference
- **Plugin Release Distribution**: Added proper GitHub Actions workflow to include compiled artifacts in releases for BRAT compatibility

### Changed

- **Grid View Column Management**: Enhanced column system with new bucket column alongside existing columns (status, priority, tags, dates, dependencies)
- **Task Detail Panel**: Expanded task properties with bucket selection interface

### Technical

- **TypeScript Improvements**: Enhanced type definitions and interfaces for better type safety
- **Workspace API Integration**: Better integration with Obsidian workspace APIs for view management
- **Build Pipeline**: Improved build configuration with proper manifest handling
