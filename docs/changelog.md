## [0.6.2] - 2026-01-13

### Added

#### Bidirectional Markdown Sync

- **Full Bidirectional Sync**: Complete two-way synchronization between plugin JSON data and vault markdown notes
    - Tasks sync to individual markdown files in `{ProjectName}/Tasks/` folders
    - YAML frontmatter contains all task metadata (status, priority, dates, dependencies, etc.)
    - Markdown body includes description, subtasks (checkbox lists), and links
    - Real-time automatic sync using metadata cache and vault event watchers
- **Markdown Content Parsing**: Full parsing of markdown files including:
    - Description text (content before first heading)
    - Subtasks from checkbox lists (`- [ ] item` format)
    - Wiki links (`[[Page]]`) and external links (`[text](url)`)
- **Sync Settings**: Three configurable options in plugin settings:
    - `enableMarkdownSync`: Toggle sync feature on/off
    - `autoCreateTaskNotes`: Automatically create markdown files when tasks are created in UI
    - `syncOnStartup`: Perform initial sync of all tasks when plugin loads
- **Manual Sync Button**: "Sync All Tasks Now" button in settings for bulk synchronization
- **Console Debugging**: Extensive logging with `[TaskSync]` prefix for troubleshooting sync operations

#### Project Metadata Tracking

- **Created/Updated Timestamps**: Projects now track creation and last updated dates

### Fixed

- **Symmetric Sync**: Markdown-to-plugin sync now captures all content (previously only YAML was synced back)

- **Sync Loop Prevention**: Set-based tracking prevents infinite sync loops between UI and markdown changes

### Technical

- **TaskSync Utility**: New `src/utils/TaskSync.ts` class managing all sync operations

- **Vault Event Handlers**: Backup watchers for file create, modify, and delete operations
- **TaskStore Methods**: New `addTaskFromObject()` and helper methods (`getTaskById`, `getTasks`) for sync integration
- **Sync State Tracking**: `syncInProgress` Set with 200ms timeout to prevent circular updates

### Documentation
