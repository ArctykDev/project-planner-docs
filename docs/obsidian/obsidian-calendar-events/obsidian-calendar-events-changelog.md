## [0.8.0] — UI Enhancements, Ribbon Icon, and Recurring Event Indicators

Released: 2025-01-22

This release introduces several user-experience improvements, visual refinements inspired by Microsoft Outlook, a new optional ribbon icon, and multiple interaction and layout enhancements.

### Added

- **Optional Ribbon Icon**  
  A new setting allows users to enable/disable a dedicated ribbon icon for quickly opening the Calendar Events view.
- **Recurring Event Indicator**  
  Events generated from recurrence rules are now clearly marked with a recurring icon.
- **Outlook-Style Ghost Hover Button**  
  The _Add to Daily Note_ button now matches Outlook’s “ghost-hover” style with a subtle circular hover region.
- **Day Group Collapse Button Rewrite**  
  Day headers now use a modern ghost-hover collapse icon for clearer interaction and visual consistency.

### Improved

- **Event Card Layout**  
  The Add-to-Daily-Note button is now positioned at the bottom-right of each event card, avoiding overlap with other UI elements.
- **Cleaner Hover Interactions**  
  Event action UI now appears without shifting layout or leaving empty rows.
- **Visual Consistency Across Elements**  
  Icons now follow a unified UI language (spacing, hover transitions, scaling).
- **Internal Settings Handling**  
  Ribbon icon state updates immediately when toggled in the settings panel.

### Fixed

- Resolved layout gaps caused by empty action rows.
- Removed inconsistent spacing around event cards during hover interactions.
- Ensured the collapse icon and add-button no longer interfere with event title or recurring indicators.

---

## Notes

This release does not introduce any breaking changes but does enhance UI consistency and interaction quality.  
Recommended for all users.

### Multi-Calendar Management, Visibility Toggles, and Expand/Collapse Controls

This release marks a major enhancement to **Obsidian Calendar Events**, introducing full **multi-calendar support**, persistent **visibility toggles**, and new **expand/collapse controls** for a cleaner and more customizable viewing experience.

---

### **New Features**

- **Multiple ICS Calendar Sources**  
  Manage multiple `.ics` calendar feeds directly from the plugin settings.  
  Each source includes:

  - Custom **name**

- **Color-Coded Events**  
  Events are now visually color-coded according to their calendar source for better clarity.

  - Color-coded to match each calendar
  - Visibility states are **persisted between sessions**

- **Expand/Collapse Date Headers**  
  Each day’s events can now be expanded or collapsed individually.

  - Collapsed states are **remembered between sessions**
  - Adds a cleaner browsing experience when viewing multiple days

- **Collapse/Expand All Button**  
  A header button (chevrons icon) now allows users to quickly collapse or expand all days.

  - Icon and tooltip update dynamically based on current state
  - Fully synchronized with individual day states

- **Calendar Legend**  
  Displays active calendars and their associated colors for an at-a-glance overview.

---

### **UI Enhancements**

- Centered and styled visibility toggle buttons using a Flexbox layout
- Added smooth hover and transition effects to toggle buttons

  - Added `visibleCalendars` to persist calendar visibility
  - Added `collapsedDays` to persist expanded/collapsed states
- **Timezone Handling**

### **Migration Notice**

No manual action is required — existing events, preferences, and view settings are preserved.

---

### **Summary**

Version **0.7.0** delivers a powerful evolution of Obsidian Calendar Events:

- Full multi-calendar management
- Color-coded and filterable events
- Persistent expand/collapse and visibility states
- Accurate timezone support

This release sets the stage for even more interactive, visually-rich calendar experiences within Obsidian.

## [0.6.4] - 2025-11-03

### New Features

- **Dynamic “Last Updated” label**  
   Displays when calendar data was last fetched. Updates automatically every minute (for example, “Updated 5 minutes ago”) and hides automatically after 24 hours of inactivity.
- **Loading indicator**  
   Added a lightweight “Loading events…” message with a subtle spinner when the plugin first loads or when the user clicks Refresh.
- **Welcome and setup screen**  
   When no calendar is configured, the plugin now shows a friendly welcome message with an **Open Settings** button. The header and toolbar remain visible for a consistent interface.
- **Auto-loading on startup**  
   The calendar automatically fetches events on startup if an iCal URL is configured, removing the need for manual refresh.
- **Smarter refresh logic**  
   The Refresh button now handles first-run conditions correctly. If no calendar is configured, it shows the setup screen instead of an endless spinner.

### UI Improvements

- **Cleaner layout**  
   The “Showing events…” and “Last updated…” lines are hidden when no calendar is configured (first-run or setup state).
- **Consistent styling**  
   Improved text alignment and spacing across all header, loading, and empty states.
- **Optional fade transition**  
   Added an optional opacity transition when switching from the loading spinner to the event view (enabled through CSS).

### Technical Enhancements

- Added a `showLoading()` helper to `CalendarView` for unified loading behavior during startup and refresh operations.
- Introduced `lastUpdated` and `updateTimer` class fields with proper cleanup in `onunload()` to prevent memory leaks.
- Updated the `onLayoutReady()` startup logic to show the loading indicator and handle both configured and first-run states cleanly.
- Minor CSS refinements for `.spcalendar-loading`, `.spcalendar-empty`, and `.spcalendar-updated` to align with the Obsidian design language.

### Tested Scenarios

- First run with no calendar configured → welcome message with **Open Settings** button
- Startup with configured calendar → loading spinner → event list
- Manual refresh (configured) → loading spinner → refreshed events
- Manual refresh (unconfigured) → setup message (no infinite spinner)
- Timestamp automatically hides after 24 hours

### Summary

This release focuses on refining the user experience, improving the startup flow, and providing clear visual feedback for loading, configuration, and refresh states. It lays the groundwork for more advanced calendar management in future versions.

## [0.6.3] - 2025-11-01

### Full Outlook Compatibility and iCal Improvements

This release delivers a major enhancement to iCal (ICS) event handling — bringing full compatibility with Outlook and Microsoft 365 calendar feeds.  
It resolves previous issues where some events appeared late, all-day events were missing, or recurring meetings failed to display.

#### ICS Parsing

- Rebuilt the `parseICS()` function for full **Outlook/Exchange compatibility**.
- Added support for:
  - **Folded multi-line fields** (RFC 5545 compliant).
  - **Escaped text** (commas, semicolons, and backslashes).
  - **All-day events** using `VALUE=DATE`.
  - **Local time zone handling (`TZID=…`)** with correct UTC conversion.
  - **Canceled or modified events** (`STATUS:CANCELLED`, `RECURRENCE-ID`).
- Normalized all timestamps to UTC for consistent rendering in Obsidian.

#### Recurrence (RRULE) Expansion

- Integrated the **`rrule`** library to expand recurring events exactly as Outlook does.
- Handles:
  - Daily, weekly, monthly, and custom recurrence patterns.
  - Exclusions and cancellations within a recurring series.
- Prevents duplicate or missing recurring instances.

#### Event Filtering and Date Range

- Adjusted `fetchEvents()` to calculate ranges using **local midnight boundaries**, ensuring complete coverage of each day.
- Added a 12-hour buffer on both sides of the date window to capture early-morning and late-night events.
- Improved overlap logic so events spanning multiple days or starting before/ending after the range are always included.

#### Diagnostics and Stability

- Added detailed console diagnostics for troubleshooting event visibility and time-zone alignment.
- Improved error handling for malformed ICS data.
- Enhanced performance and parsing stability.

---

### Result

The plugin now matches Outlook’s calendar view exactly — including recurring meetings, all-day events, cancellations, and localized start/end times — while maintaining smooth performance and reliability inside Obsidian.
