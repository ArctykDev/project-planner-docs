# [0.6.6] Development release 

Version 0.6.6 patches more bugs! 

I am putting a lot of effort towards fixing bugs, cleaning up the code and ensuring the plugin follows Obsidian's plugin guidelines. The next few releases will likely be small patch releases with the goal of providing a stable, solid foundation for adding new and improved features. 

## Bug Fix List
Here is a list of bugs that have been fixed for 0.6.6:

- **Dashboard cleanup**
    - Removed completed tasks from Dashboard views 
    - Added Dashboard view to Default View options in plugin settings 
    - Show all Projects on Dashboard now displays all tasks for all projects correctly
- **Code cleanup to adhere to Obsidian plugin guidelines**
    - Plugin code now adheres to the Obsidian plugin guidelines

    - Tasks are now being updated and generated by notes
    - Markdown notes are now generated using the correct folder pattern Project Planner > Project Name > Tasks so things stay neat and tidy
