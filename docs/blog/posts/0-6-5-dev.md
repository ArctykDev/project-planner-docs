# [0.6.5] Development release 

Version 0.6.5 patches several annoying bugs, most notably for Obsidian Sync users, it fixes an issue where tasks were getting duplicated on Obsidian startup. 

If you are using Obsidian Sync, please update your Project Planner to version 0.6.5 and disable **Sync on Starup** in the Markdown Sync section of the plugin settings. This will help prevent tasks from duplicating.
