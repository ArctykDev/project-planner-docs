# [0.6.3] Development Release

Version 0.6.3 introduces a powerful new workflow for Project Planner: **Daily Note Task Tagging**. This release bridges the gap between your daily note-taking and project management by automatically importing tagged tasks from anywhere in your vault directly into your projects.

Simply tag any task in your daily notes, meeting logs, or journals with `#planner`, and it instantly appears in your project board—complete with auto-detected priorities, due dates, and tags. For teams juggling multiple projects, you can route tasks to specific projects using `#planner/ProjectName`. The feature includes real-time file watching, smart metadata parsing, and a one-click "Scan Now" button to catch up on existing notes.

This update makes it effortless to capture tasks wherever your thoughts flow, without breaking context to switch to a dedicated project view.
