# Sharing Ideas for New Features

We love hearing your ideas! [GitHub Discussions](https://github.com/ArctykDev/obsidian-project-planner/discussions/categories/ideas) is the best place to share feature requests, suggest improvements, and propose changes to Project Planner. Your input helps shape the future of the plugin and ensures it serves the community's needs.

## Before Submitting an Idea

Before creating a new discussion, please:

1. **Search existing discussions** to see if someone else has already suggested something similar
2. **Check the [documentation](../index.md)** to confirm the feature doesn't already exist
3. **Review the [changelog](../changelog.md)** to see if it's planned or recently added

This helps avoid duplicate discussions and makes it easier for everyone to find and support existing ideas.

## What Makes a Good Feature Request

The most helpful feature requests include:

### Clear Description

Explain what you want to achieve, not just what you want added. For example:

- ✅ "I need a way to see all tasks due this week across multiple projects so I can plan my workload"
- ❌ "Add a weekly view"

### Use Case

Describe your specific scenario or workflow:

- What problem are you trying to solve?
- How would this feature improve your workflow?
- Are there workarounds you're currently using?

### Context and Examples

Help us visualize your idea:

- Provide mockups or screenshots if applicable
- Reference similar features in other tools (if relevant)
- Include example tasks or projects that would benefit

### Consider the Philosophy

Project Planner embraces Obsidian's values of local-first, plain text, and flexibility. Consider:

- How would this work with markdown files?
- Does it respect the local-first approach?
- Could it integrate with existing Obsidian workflows?

## What Happens Next

After you submit an idea:

1. **Community Discussion**: Other users can comment, provide feedback, and upvote
2. **Developer Review**: We review all ideas and evaluate them based on:
   - Alignment with Project Planner's philosophy
   - Benefit to the broader user base
   - Technical feasibility
   - Impact on performance and maintainability
3. **Status Updates**: We'll update the discussion with our thoughts and potential timeline
4. **Implementation**: If approved, we'll add it to the roadmap and keep you updated

!!! tip "Increase Your Idea's Visibility"
Engage with the discussion by responding to questions and refining your proposal based on feedback. Well-thought-out ideas with community support are more likely to be prioritized.

## Examples of Great Feature Requests

Here are examples of well-structured feature requests:

### Example 1: Task Templates

**Title**: "Add task templates for repeating project structures"

**Description**: I manage similar projects every month (e.g., monthly newsletter creation) and find myself recreating the same task structure each time. It would be helpful to have task templates that I could apply to new projects.

**Use Case**: Each month I create a new newsletter project with ~15 standard tasks (outline, draft, review, design, etc.). Currently, I manually create each task or copy from a previous project.

**Proposed Solution**: A "Save as Template" option that stores the task structure (names, dependencies, estimated duration) that can be applied when creating a new project.

**Alternatives Considered**: I've tried using Obsidian Templates plugin, but it doesn't preserve task relationships or properties.

### Example 2: Custom Fields

**Title**: "Support for custom task fields beyond the default properties"

**Description**: Different projects need different metadata. For development projects, I want to track "Story Points" and "Sprint Number", while for content projects, I need "Target Audience" and "Content Type".

**Use Case**: My development team uses story points for estimation, but there's currently no field for this. We're adding them in task descriptions, but then they're not filterable or reportable.

**Proposed Solution**: Allow users to define custom fields in YAML frontmatter that appear in the task details view and can be used for filtering/grouping in various views.

**Markdown Compatibility**: Custom fields would be stored as additional YAML properties, keeping everything in plain text.

## Supporting Other Ideas

If you find an existing idea you like:

- 👍 Upvote the discussion
- 💬 Add your use case or perspective in the comments
- 🔗 Share it with others who might benefit

Community support helps us prioritize features that will have the greatest impact.

## Questions or Unclear?

If you're not sure whether something should be a feature request, bug report, or general question:

- **Feature Request**: Something new that doesn't currently exist
- **Bug Report**: Something that exists but isn't working correctly
- **Question**: You're not sure how to do something or if it's possible

When in doubt, start a discussion in the [Q&A category](https://github.com/ArctykDev/obsidian-project-planner/discussions/categories/q-a), and we'll help you determine the best path forward.

Thank you for helping make Project Planner better! 🚀
