# Contributing

Project Planner is an actively maintained and constantly evolving plugin serving the [Obisidian community](https://forum.obsidian.md/) and [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/) users. In order to efficiently address, evaluate feature requests, and fix bugs, we invest significant effort into the plugin's development and community support.

If you are using this plugin or have questions, we invite you to open new issues and post in the discussion board. This will help us grow the [issue tracker](https://github.com/ArctykDev/obsidian-project-planner/issues) and [discussion board](https://github.com/ArctykDev/obsidian-project-planner/discussions) into a valuable knowledge base providing insights and solutions for both new and experienced users.

## How to contribute

We understand that reporting bugs and engaging in discussions can be time-consuming, so we're committed to making these interactions as smooth and efficient as possible.

Our goals are to maintain well-structured, up-to-date, and accessible documentation while adhering to [Obsidian Developer Policies](https://docs.obsidian.md/Developer+policies), ensuring you get the most out of both Project Planner and Obsidian.
