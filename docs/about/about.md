# About Project Planner

## How Project Planner Came to Be

Project Planner was born from a belief in Obsidian's core values and a recognition that the ecosystem lacked robust project management capabilities. After finding Microsoft OneNote lacking in customizability and essential features, I realized that many users—especially those without access to paid platforms like Microsoft 365—deserved professional-grade project management tools within their local-first workspace. The vision was clear: build the perfect project management plugin on the perfect base platform, Obsidian. The result is a comprehensive plugin inspired by Microsoft Planner that brings multiple specialized views—[Grid](../views/grid-view.md), [Board](../views/board-view.md), [Gantt](../views/timeline-view.md), [Dashboard](../views/dashboard-view.md), and [Dependency Graph](../views/dependency-graph-view.md)—alongside bidirectional [markdown sync](../features/markdown-sync.md), seamlessly blending enterprise-grade task management with Obsidian's local-first philosophy.
